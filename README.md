# ETSI DCC Access implementation for ns3

This is a software module for the network simulator ns-3 that implements the DCC (Decentralized Congestion Control) Access protocol specified by ETSI in TS 102 687 v1.2.1. DCC controls the data traffic injected by each vehicle to the radio channel for ITS-G5. It makes use of Prioritization, Queuing and Flow Control. This module has been tested with ns-3.26 and ns-3.20, but can be easily integrated in other versions of ns-3. We plan to integrate it into the iTETRIS simulation platform, which is being updated and evolved in the H2020 TransAID research project.
